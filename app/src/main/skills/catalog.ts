/**
 * Curated built-in skills catalog.
 *
 * Skills are pure instruction text — playbooks the model follows once it invokes
 * one. They carry zero runtime cost (no process, no network), so unlike the MCP
 * catalog a small set of *safe essentials* defaults ON (coding, debugging,
 * planning, project analysis, codebase exploration); everything else is opt-in.
 *
 * Context stays lean: only ENABLED skills appear in the prompt's short listing,
 * and a skill's full body is injected only when the model actually invokes it
 * (see the engine's `use_skill` handling) — so a dozen catalog skills cost a few
 * lines of listing, not a dozen playbooks.
 *
 * A few skills declare `requiresMcp`: they lean on a catalog MCP server (e.g.
 * Git, Web Fetch). The UI surfaces that dependency and offers to enable the
 * server — it is never silently enabled. Built-ins are merged with disk-authored
 * skills ({@link ../skills/registry}); a disk skill of the same name overrides
 * the built-in, so users can customize any playbook by dropping a SKILL.md.
